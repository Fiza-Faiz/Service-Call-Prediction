# Service Call Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting the number of service calls a company is likely to receive on a given day. The prediction is based on historical data on service calls and weather conditions.

## Getting Started
To get started with this code, you'll need to have the following:

1. R program

## Data
The data folder contains the following files:

- service_calls.csv: This file contains historical data on service calls, including the number of calls and the date they were received.
- weather.csv: This file contains historical weather data, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

## Usage
To use this code, open the Service-Call-Prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in order. The notebook will load the data, clean it, preprocess it, and train a machine learning model to make predictions. The final output will be a plot showing the predicted number of service calls for the next seven days.

## Credits
This code was created by Fiza Faiz. The data used in this code was obtained from OpenWeatherMap and Kaggle.
